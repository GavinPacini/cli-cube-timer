# Rubiks' Cube Timer on the Command Line

> Time your solves, without leaving the terminal.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/cli-cube-timer.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/cli-cube-timer)

## Why?

I was tired of having to go to a browser, and even more tired of not getting to clear
my cookies now and then. And also, with living with the fear of the cookies getting cleared
accidentally, and me losing my whole solve history!

So, this is a hack around that. 

## Usage

### solve

> Primary command line executable name.

This will begin a solving session. All session statistics will be stored locally for this session.
Solve times are stored universally at `~/.cube/times.csv`.
