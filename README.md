# Rubiks' Cube Timer on the Command Line

Time your solves, without leaving the terminal.

I was tired of having to go to a browser, and even more tired of not getting to clear
my cookies now and then. And also, with living with the fear of the cookies getting cleared
accidentally, and me losing my whole solve history!

So, this is a hack around that. 

**Note: There's a lot of work to be done here!**

I would love to have your help on this! Do check out the issues dashboard of this repository,
and submit a PR on any one of those issues, and I will be happy to merge!
